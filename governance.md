**Candidate statement**

I am honored to stand for election to the IDEA Board. My career has centered on democratizing access to research, mentorship, and professional networks in development economics—goals that align closely with IDEA’s vision for global research inclusion and career development.

As Co-Director of the Global Action for Policy (GAP), I have helped build institutional platforms that expand scholarly exchange across disciplines and geographies, including seminar series, working paper infrastructure, global research partnerships, and hosting NEUDC 2024. Through AMIE, which I co-founded, we have mentored more than 140 PhD students worldwide, institutionalized structured job-market preparation, and built durable mentoring networks that directly address inequities in access to professional capital.

On the IDEA Board, I would prioritize three areas: building scalable global feedback infrastructure for scholars outside major research hubs; strengthening structured, full-pipeline career development systems; and creating transparent collaboration platforms that reduce reliance on informal gatekeeping networks.
